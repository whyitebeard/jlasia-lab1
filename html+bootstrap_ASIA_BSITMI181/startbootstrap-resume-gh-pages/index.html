							 It's also my pleasure to meet you. I came where corrupt administration reigns and biased -- poor public service occurs, welcome to Pasay City!
							 Well, I wished I can tell you some of my adventures, but unfortunately there are mine to keep. Don't worry, I still have another category to speak about. In my freshmen year, I joined different organization where I was unexpectedly nominated as a executive board member. They kept and trained me on how to speak and debate appropriately. I'm using it for my further cost on my daily living, especially on my studies which is a fundamental skill to have -- on the modern society, at least. A memorable event occurred when I compete on a debate inter-varsity as a member of this organization which is a hard task to do. But, despite of all circumstances I was able to fight and learn as much as possible that I can use on my further exploration in this society.
							 Moving forward, there are many things that are surprising for each person and I'll gladly tell you mine. One of those is being open-minded when most people are not. Regardless of my religion and family orientation, I keep my own perspective and opinion about life and how to deal with it. Because at first, it is not their life to live. but it's mine -- alone. Surely, they can guarantee to give me guidance that I would need, but the decisions that I would chose is not theirs to make.
							 To end this speech, I'm expecting that our professor would guide us on the fountain of knowledge where information, skills, etc. waits ahead to be drink or sip by her students because learning isn't the professor`s task to do.

            <p>Honestly speaking, I don`t have any favorite application. But, I think it would be similar to “what app caught your interest?” 
			   and my answer would be, Google Earth. Knowing that it is expensive to go on a journey, fear not, this application got you covered 
			   from different places, tourist spots, as well as other information that can help on your exploration. Aside from that, it also contains 
			   details about the location, its distance between you and your destination which is a fundamental thing to have as a traveler.
               Two months ago, when I installed this application, it’s been my basic source for discovering places where I haven`t visited yet 
			   and immerge myself into things that I wanted to see, virtually. Everything in here is essential, from its information regards to real time updates 
			   about the current status quo of the place, current events, and tourist destination. We, as a middle-class individual, will surely benefit from this 
			   free application given its features and friendly user interface. </p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">How would you design an interface for a 1000 floor elevator</h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-3">Assumption</div>
            <p> Given this opportunity to construct an exclusive elevator which would cater one thousand floors, I hereby declare my own solution for this task which includes the following details:
					-	Dedicated emergency button and interface
					-	Built-in snack store
					-	Air-conditioned
					-	30 available seats
					-	Air freshener (System base)
					-	Precise Estimated Time of Arrival
					-	Equipped with fast transportation system
					-	Divided into 100 floors (10 elevators) 

					Does these features will greatly benefit the client from its need?
					Assurance is given, due to security system which directly coordinates with the guard/personnel 
					for any in great need of assistance (failure of power supply, stuck on a floor, natural calamities, and the likes). </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="whitebeard-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between">
          <div class="whitebeard-content">
            <h3 class="mb-0">CONTINUATION</h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-3">A3</div>
            <p> In addition, defense security is equipped for any unexpected external damage which will automatically trigger the system 
				to exceed its structure by fortifying the metals, cables, etc. of the elevator. These equipment are technologically advanced, 
				simply saying they are developed to furtherly reduce the accidents that may occur. Also, on the internal emergencies, there is the interface 
				that directly communicates with the security administration for them to give further assistance and solve any issues that may arise. 
				If the issue wasn’t solved, the security has to instruct users to press the red button to immediately stop the operation of the elevator. 
				This allows the individuals to exit the elevator on a specific floor that ensures the safest route available.
				Moving forward, my next premise will be the cleanliness of the elevators’ air is minutely monitored by the air-vent system which was invented to prevent
				 and eliminate unwanted smell that can cause inconvenience to the users. The system will check if there are any anomalies within the air, if proven it would 
				 give warning to the individuals that air freshener will be sprayed within 20 seconds. But, air freshener will also spray the place for every 30 minutes.
				Knowing that there are 1000 floors and it is equally divided to 100 per elevator, the structure also includes selling of snacks inside the elevator 
				to cater the hungry individuals. Employees can pay the product/s through their ID validation using their unique ID number and would be deducted on their salary.
				Last but not least, is the speed of transportation. I, in behalf of my colleagues, would like present the future of elevators, 
				“The Mayt”. This system allows to greatly reduce the time spent by the employees on waiting for their destination. 
				How? System, will teleport the elevator on the in queue floors. But, there will be specific range of floors that can only be teleported to. 
				For example, if you are on floor 13 and you’ll go to floor 15 in between no individuals pressed the button for the elevator on floor 14 t
				hen you’ll be regularly transported without teleportation. If you were on floor 30 and pressed floor 50 which there were no individuals 
				pressed the button in between 31 and 49 you’ll be automatically teleported. These are the conditions, simply saying there are regular and 
				teleport system that will be implemented. </p>

			<p> Problem:
				In the current status quo of our society, people have the capability to think of travelling on places they haven`t visited yet. 
				They are enticed with the beautiful views of nature along with its different activities and events to begin with. 
				People are always looking forward on creating unforgettable moments, experiences and memories with or without their love ones.
				Searching different places for possible vacation would be easy due to today`s technology but, the problem begins when there are varieties 
				of information on the internet and people are confused because when these are compared on each other it produces unmatched result.

				Needs;
				•	A travel guide that contains information about different tourist’s spot, restaurant, do’s and don’ts, etiquettes, 
					and basic language of a certain country.
				•	Gathered precise information as a guidance on travelling to different places.</p>
